# Homework Week 6

I'll say it straight out, I definitely didn't leave myself enough time for this one. Math is not and has never been my strongest subject, and despite rereading the course lessons multiple times, I'm still having trouble understanding the function of the different variables and equations. I have a cautious understanding of the math outside of coding, but it's just not clicking what the equations do inside of the code.

I figured that the best way to figure this stuff out would be to copy the example over, change values, and watch what happened in the browser after the changes. At least, that's a method I've heard of being really effective. I feel a little better about the variable thing after having done that, but I also feel like I only managed to break the code. Somehow I made the background black and completely eliminated movement from the piece. I tried to reverse back to where it worked with no luck.
