# Week 10 Homework

I like arrays; which I know are technically from last week, but we didn't have homework then. The way that information is pulled from them makes more sense to me than the previoous ways we've been looking at.

For my project, since functions and arrays were the two foci, I decided I'd take my favorite examples from the Array and Function sections and try to combine them. My first idea was to make the blinking star from the Array section move around the screen like the smiley faces at the end of the Function section. However, since I couldn't quite get that to work, I thought maybe I could get the stars to move randomly across the canvas without spinning instead.
