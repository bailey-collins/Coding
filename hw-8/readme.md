# Week 8 Homework

I really liked the example animation with the randomly appearing circles in the *while loop* section, so I thought I'd try to create something similar. I wanted to make an animation where triangles would appear randomly in random colors and look like they were growing and shrinking by changing their side lengths while they were visible.

I had trouble getting my code to display. I think maybe there was something going wrong with my internet, because I couldn't get any of my older codes to display in the browser either. In any case, I was kind of flying blind on this one, since I couldn't check up on it while I worked. Hopefully, I didn't do anything that broke the code- I tried to be careful and double-check everything, but I'm not sure.
