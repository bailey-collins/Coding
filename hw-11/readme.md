# Week 11 Homework

I was much more hopeful at the beginning of this module than the last few, as I felt like I understood the concept of Classes and Objects more than I had the more numerical-based items. However, even though I spent more time than usual trying to get a working code, I couldn't quite get it to do what I wanted.

My intention was to create a line of triangles that would "spin" by displaying a two or three different triangles with the same central point and different angle points. I couldn't get any of the triangles to display correctly. I tried reading back through the previous modules which I thought would help and also tried to google up a solution, but didn't find anything that helped me understand what I was doing wrong. I ended up submitting the most likely variant of code I had that didn't throw any errors.
