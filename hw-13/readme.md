# Week 13 Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to try to keep it simple, since I've been struggling to write code without breaking it. My plan is to create a icon of a little pixel fairy in Photoshop and then try to apply different layers of code to it so that it looks a certain way and does a few different things, such as:

**Basic Plan**
- Fairy follows the mouse when it is moved around the canvas
- Fairy switches positions based on the direction the mouse is moving
- Implement a background of trees

**Advanced Plan**
- Small shapes float around the canvas
- Shapes disappear when the fairy "flies" through/over them
- Fairy moves behind certain elements of the background and in front of others
- Fairy "dances" when moved to a certain corner of the screen
- Implement music when the mouse is clicked

I want to try and keep the different "layers" kind of distinct, so that if I can't make one of them work, especially one of the more "advanced" ones work, I can remove or modify them more easily.


I was somewhat inspired from a relatively silly game I really enjoyed in my childhood called Pixie Hollow. This was a Disney game based off of a trilogy of books the company had commissioned from one of my favorite authors about their version of the character Tinker Bell. The trilogy branched out into several shorter books, the game in question, and a few truly awful movies. The game, like most Disney games, consisted of a "chat room" public area that served as a transition point between different minigames. In the public area, wherever you moved your mouse was where you fairy avatar would fly, and randomly appearing items would pop up for the different players to collect. I often had more fun "flying" around the common area and collecting things than I did playing the games. I think a simplified version of that might be right up my alley.
Here's what the fairies from the game looked like. Mine will be quite a bit simpler:

I'm trying to work on the mouse tracking. I know it was one of the first things we learned, but I've had a lot of issues trying to get it right, so I'm attempting it here. Just about everything I'm planning has to do with mouse tracking/mouse interaction- "flying," "collecting," and moving "behind" objects especially- so I'm hoping to really get it down. I'm not quite sure if the switching directions thing is feasible, but I'm going to do some research. The dancing is my attempt at incorporating the sprite animation from this week, as I thought that was really cool, but I'm not sure how well it will work out. The music is a similar situation- it's a cool feature, but it's new, I'm not sure of it, and I'd rather focus on the other stuff instead.


**Plan**
1. Build the sprite of the fairy in the different flying positions (already begun, as shown here)

2. Import the sprite into the code using techniques from Week 13

3. Import the background (something like below) using similar methods, or build a "forest" with basic shapes like explained in Weeks 3 and 4

4. Use the techniques from Weeks 5 and 6 to make the fairy follow the mouse

5. Use else/if statements to make her change direction based on the movement of the mouse (Week 7)

6.
