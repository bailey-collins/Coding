# Week 13 Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to try to keep it simple, since I've been struggling to write code without breaking it. My plan is to create a icon of a little pixel fairy in Photoshop and then try to apply different layers of code to it so that it looks a certain way and does a few different things, such as:

**Basic Plan**
- Fairy follows the mouse when it is moved around the canvas
- Fairy switches positions based on the direction the mouse is moving
- Implement a background of trees

**Advanced Plan**
- Small shapes float around the canvas
- Shapes disappear when the fairy "flies" through/over them
- Fairy moves behind certain elements of the background and in front of others
- Fairy "dances" when moved to a certain corner of the screen
- Implement music when the mouse is clicked

I want to try and keep the different "layers" kind of distinct, so that if I can't make one of them work, especially one of the more "advanced" ones work, I can remove or modify them more easily.


I was somewhat inspired from a relatively silly game I really enjoyed in my childhood called Pixie Hollow. This was a Disney game based off of a trilogy of books the company had commissioned from one of my favorite authors about their version of the character Tinker Bell. The trilogy branched out into several shorter books, the game in question, and a few truly awful movies. The game, like most Disney games, consisted of a "chat room" public area that served as a transition point between different minigames. In the public area, wherever you moved your mouse was where you fairy avatar would fly, and randomly appearing items would pop up for the different players to collect. I often had more fun "flying" around the common area and collecting things than I did playing the games. I think a simplified version of that might be right up my alley.
