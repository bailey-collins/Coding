# Week Four Homework

I chose to do a monster instead of a portrait. I initially wanted to create my own monster, since I love doodling monsters, but I thought I might learn the concept better if I was trying to copy/redo an existing design. So, I chose Mike Wazowski from Monster's Inc.

Most of my issues occurred with placement. I had a hard time imagining the grid over my browser, and I'm not a super spatial thinker when it comes to grids and numbers. It took a lot of experimentation to get everything to sit in the correct places. I was committing my files every other minute or so. In the future, I honestly might take some tracing paper and draw the grid so that I can hold it over my canvas.

My problems weren't really the type that could be solved by the issue board, so I didn't have cause to use it this time, but I kept an eye on it in case anything popped up that I knew a solution for.

Here's my reference picture for the project.
