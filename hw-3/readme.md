["Hello World!" Sketch](https://bailey-collins.github.io/Coding/hw-3/)

I created a p5 file for the first time and edited it. I think somewhere my files got snarled up, because it took a few tries and modifications to get my webpage to display correctly, but I think I got there in the end, so no harm done. I didn't post anything to the issue board, but I also didn't see anyone else posting on it, so it seems like we're all okay so far. I'm excited to play around more with the ability to draw with code- I didn't know that was possible before.
