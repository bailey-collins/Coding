# Week 5 Homework

I have to say, I like this animation a bit better than the animations I was doing in my photoshop class. When it comes to making geometric designs, I think p5 might be the way to go.

I did have quite a few problems attempting to get the browser to display my code. Sometimes, my design would show up but not update, other times, it wouldn't display anything at all. I tried multiple times to fiddle with the code in order to fix it, but I couldn't get anything straightened out, so I'm still not sure what went wrong.

I tried to post to the issues board, but I think either I accidentally posted to the wrong board or my question didn't submit properly, because I never got an answer.
