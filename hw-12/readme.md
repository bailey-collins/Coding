# Homework Week 12

I was going for a simple "game" animation where one could use the mouse to click and drag circles around the frame. I also hoped to include something to make it so that the circles would reflect off of each other if you bumped them, but it got away from me. The whole project kind of got away from me, honestly.

I really didn't understand much of anything that was going on in this lesson. I was super confused, so I tried to find concepts that were similar to mine on online forums and YouTube and figure out the concepts, but I feel like I didn't get anywhere. Once again, I couldn't even get the basic shapes to display, and I'm not sure why. The editor on Chrome kept displaying an error that one of my call methods, a ballCheck thing, I believe, was not a function, but since I wasn't trying to use it as a function, I didn't know how to fix it. I messed with it for a long time, and I'm submitting the code that threw the fewest errors.
